## How to grow glutes

# The rule of thirds

The rules of thirds are developed by **Bret Contreras** (aka **The glutes guy**). He is the **inventor of Hip Thrust** and a world-leading glute expert.

To maximize the potential of the glutes, the rules of thirds said that

> In terms of effort, around 1/3 of your sets should be carried out to failure or 1 rep shy of failure, 1/3 of your sets should be performed to 2-3 reps shy of failure, and 1/3 of your sets should be taken nowhere close to failure.

## Exercises by vectors

| Vertically loaded exercises | Horizontally loaded exercises | Lateral/Rotary loaded exercises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - Squat & squat variation<br>- Deadlift & deadlift variation<br>- Leg press<br>- Step-ups<br>- Lunges | - Hip thrust and hip thrust variation<br>- Bridges<br>- Frog pump<br>- Back extension<br>- Reverse hypers | - Sidekick exercises<br>- Kickback exercises<br>- Hip abduction exercises<br>- Fire hydrant<br>- Lateral band walk<br>- Swings |
| - Develop lower glutes<br>- Low reps: 3 - 10 reps | - Develop upper/lower glutes<br>- Medium reps: >= 10 | - Develop upper glutes<br>- High reps: >= 15 to AMAP (as much as possible) |

> Vertically loaded glute exercises are the hardest on the body and work lower than upper glute max fibers. 

> Horizontal is less taxing overall but highly activates both the upper and lower subdivisions. 

> Frontal plane lateral exercises completely target the upper subdivision of the glute max, whereas transverse plane hip abduction and hip external rotation exercises work both the upper and lower fibers.

> To make things more complicated, you also have blends and combinations of vectors.

##  Exercises by body part domination

| Glute dominant exercises | Quad dominant exercises | Hamstring dominant exercises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - Hip thrust and hip thrust variation<br> - Bridges<br>- Frog pump<br>- Sidekick exercises<br>- Kickback exercises<br>- Hip abduction exercises<br>- Fire hydrant<br>- Lateral band walk<br>- RKC plank | - Squat & squat variation<br>- Step-ups<br>- Leg press<br>- Sled pushes | - Deadlift & deadlift variation<br>- Back extension<br>- Reverse hypers<br>- Swings<br>- Knee flexion exercises |
| - *Hip thrust* should be placed at the beginning of your workouts.<br>- *Hip abduction exercises* are great for burnouts and developing upper glutes. They should be placed at the end of your workouts.<br>- *RKC plank* is great to work the core and should be the last exercise. | - *Squats* should be placed at the beginning of your workouts.<br>- *Step-ups*, *Leg press* should be placed in the middle of your workouts. | - *Deadlift* should be placed at the beginning of your workouts.<br>- *Back extension* and *Reverse hyper exercises* elicit higher glutes activation than other hamstring-dominant exercises. |

# Q&A

## How many days should you train your glutes?

The glute guy said 3 to 5 depending on the volume. I often train my glutes with heavyweights (around 70 - 80% of 1RM - 1 Rep Max). I can only train my glutes 3 days a week. My lower body will be sore. I need 1 - 2 days to recover. But if you use the medium to lightweights, you can train up to 5 times a week.

## High reps or low reps?

- Low reps: 3 to 5
- Medium: 8 to 10
- High reps: > 10

There are no exercises that work for everybody. Everyone is different. I saw a lot of girls with great glutes doing mostly medium/high reps schema. I love low/medium reps schema but I try to keep everything in balance.

I always start with the low reps exercises: vertically exercises such as Squat or Deadlift or Hip thrust, followed by the medium reps exercises such as squat variation exercises (Split squats, Bulgarian split squats, Step-ups, …) or deadlift variation exercises (single-leg deadlift, back extension, sumo deadlift, …) and finish with the lateral/rotary exercises (15 to AMAP) such as Seated Hip Abduction, Sidekick, Kickback, …

## How to choose the right weights?

If your form is not good, please find a mentor, or at least try to firm yourself when you're working out, then compare your form with the correct way that was taught in the book [Starting strengh](https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-Mark-Rippetoe-ebook-dp-B006XJR5ZA/dp/B006XJR5ZA/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=).

It is not easy for a novice to pick the proper weights for each exercise. If you don't have a mentor. Here is the formula that I use to pick up my weight.

For example, if you want to do 10 reps of Squats, you should pick a weight that you can do a maximum of 10-12 reps.
