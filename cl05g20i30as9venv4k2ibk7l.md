## Summary of the book "What is blockchain?"

Here is my summary of the book [What is blockchain?](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-blockchain)

- Blockchain principles
    - Start with the story of Changpeng Zhao - a blockchain billionaire in less than a year.
    - He created **Binance** in 2017 a flatform to transfer bitcoin and altcoins.
    - **Network Effects**
        
        > *For every user who joins a blockchain, the more valuable that blockchain becomes.*
        
        > ... networks that are more open are generally more successful.
        
        - The sweet spot between **permissioned** and **permissionless.**

    - **Eliminate the Intermediaries**
        - Story of apple juice supplement. The more middleman in the process, the more price customers will pay.
        - W*here do we have inefficient intermediaries?* Who can we eliminate from our supply chain? “Going direct to the customer” has always been a way to save money for both producers and consumers.
        - *where can we eliminate steps in our supply chain?* 
        Where can we replace a centralized record keeper with a decentralized ledger? Where can we eliminate an intermediary? That’s where a blockchain solution is often hiding.
    - ****Code, Not Contracts****
        - A contract is paperwork that records a transaction between two or more parties.
        - A **smart contract** is computer code that establishes agreements between parties and then executes the transaction when certain conditions are met, without the need for a third party.
        - Still don’t understand the idea of it???
    - Forking bitcoin should be avoidable for 2 main reasons
        - You lose users
        - You are more likely to fork again
