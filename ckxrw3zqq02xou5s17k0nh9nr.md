## Connect the dots

I was a good student. I got high scores at school. I loved sciences, especially Mathematics. But I didn't know what position I was supposed to do in the future.

My early 20s started by dropping out of university. I found it not for me. Students preferred certificates over knowledge. This wasn't how to I used to think when I was 18. I was disappointed and upset.

To survive, I became a waitress, then a housekeeper, then a tailor. I live my career on autopilot.

"Life is so boring. How to get out of it?" - I wondered.

In 2017, I made friends with some Uzbeks. They were computer science students at [Inha University](https://inha.uz/). I was curious about what they do in their leisure time. So I asked them if they would like to share what they did. A week later, I wrote my first line of code in C++.

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

I continued to learn to code for fun. It was hard. That's why it was so fun.

"Should I become a coder?" - I wondered.

2 years later, I got my first job as a Web Developer. WOW! I did it without applying for an internship. I tripled my income. Awesome!

Last year, I experienced burnout and quit my job with no plan. Although this seemed terrible at first, I realized that not a bad decision. I started to acknowledge what I really want to become, what mistakes I made. I built some plans to expand my skillsets during this time.  

4 months later, I got my second job. 

Coming from a JavaScript background, I have always wanted to learn a static-typed programming language, this year I picked up **Go** after reading the reviews about the language. 

Now, 15 months in, I tried to fill the gap between me - an amateur and a professional. I'm happy with my career development. I do what I love every day - to build something useful.

If you asked me what I was supposed to be in my early 20s. I would say I don't know. I wasn't good at anything and not interested in anything. Now, everything has changed.
