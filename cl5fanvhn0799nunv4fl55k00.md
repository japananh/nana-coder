## Random people make my day

# The blind pianist

I attended a piano concert this week. The blind girl played a piece by Chopin that was named [Nocturne op .9 No. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg). The melody was so familiar to me that I guessed its name correctly. I wept tears of joy to see her smile and her performance. Although, she made a few mistakes and her face looked worried a bit but for me, she did a great job. When her dark brighten me, I knew hope never ends.

# Ben Hoyt

This guy created an [AWK interpreter that is written in the Go language](https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk). He was inspired by the book [AWK programming](https://ia903404.us.archive.org/0/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf) and his father who taught him coding when he was a kid. I was just wondering if I would make the same story when my kid wrote in his/her blog "My mom taught me science and programming when I was a kid. She is my inspiration to create XYZ library". For more info about his work, you can check out his blog [here](https://benhoyt.com/).

Besides his successful career, he also has an amazing life with piano and a fantastic family with 3 lovely daughters. I enjoy reading their family blog named [Alien in the Apple](https://aliensintheapple.com/). I will become a great mother someday.

# The classical music lover

I met T, an introverted technical man with a heart for classical music, in the small tech talk about JavaScript that I was a host in 2019 in Hanoi. We exchanged Facebook contact but didn't talk for a long time. I was a shy girl so I read all of his posts and loved them so much but never texted him. He has been practicing guitar for over 10 years. This year, he decided to learn violin. I wanna try to learn the violin to make sure I love it as much as the feeling when I enjoy the violin expert playing pieces of classical music. So I asked him to try his violin. It turned out, that I did love it. We also had a great conversation about violin, physics, and religion. 

We met again in the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology this week. When he told me about the journey of a woman who bought land in Dalat to live her self-sufficient lifestyle and then realized that her dream was impractical, some pieces of my memories came back. I had a question that I tried to answer for many years since I graduated from high school.

> "Why did I turn boring quickly and NOT wanna see people?"
> "Why did I NOT have any interested in any conversation with anyone I've met for many years?"

All of his stories were so cute and hilarious with his passion for art and science. *He was exactly the type of friend that I usually hung out with when I was in school.* 

Most people grow up and lost their ability to be freedom of mind because of their social responsibilities and their willingness. All the conversations I had with them were about career growth, financial advice, or general topics such as weather, food, traveling, etc. Nothing touched my heart. I felt empty and exhausted after that but didn't know why. We smiled. The place was comfortable. I knew there was something wrong but I didn't know what is it. Today was the best day of my life. I found it. FANTASTIC!
