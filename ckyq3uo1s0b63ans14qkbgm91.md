## Who has been an influence on you?

We all have people who have changed our lives. People can change your life in a positive or negative way. Master Thich Nhat Hanh is my inspiration to live a better life.

His drama talks and his mantras help me overcome my anger. I read this mantra many many times years ago until the anger was gone. If you're dealing with your anger, I hope this helps.

[He left our beautiful world today](https://langmai.org/cong-tam-quan/thong-bach/cao-pho-thien-su-thich-nhat-hanh-vien-tich/?fbclid=IwAR23iBZz9j5DBOESkZd0UV6hI_f1V3m0VfyGptOTKQRRX-Ctx8EdU-7qPDQ). His compassion and his wisdom are still our guides and shell never pass away. "I place my faith in Amida Buddha."

# Anger Mantra

```md
Breathing in, 
I know that anger is here. 
Breathing out, 
I know that the anger is not me. 
Breathing in, 
I know that anger is unpleasant. 
Breathing out, 
I know this feeling will pass.
Breathing in, 
I am calm. 
Breathing out, 
I am strong enough to take care of this anger.
```
