## How to create a better morning routine?

I'm a morning person. My most productive time is in the morning, so I try to accomplish as many things as I can before lunch. It took me a while to find my morning routine with trials and errors. Today, I'm gonna share with you my morning routines.

# Making your bed

This is the first thing you should do. I got this advice from Tim Ferriss on his channel on Youtube. You can check it out [here](https://youtu.be/LHAyE0UC5I4?t=50). He explained that

> Accomplishing one thing at the beginning of the day no matter what happens with unforeseen variables for the rest of day. 

> You will return to a made bed at the end of the day. As a bookmark beginning an end, it sets you up psychologically to be more productive.

> If you work at home, an external mess creates an internal mess.

# Awake nervous system

The next thing you should do is that awake your nervous system.

## See sunlight early in the morning

I got this advice from Huberman (an American neuroscientist) in his article. Blue light from sunlight early in the morning can block **melatonin**, a hormone made in the body to regulate night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. It is similar to an alarm that wakes you up in the morning and makes you sleepy in the evening.

## Do light exercises

If seeing the blue light is not enough for you, light exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, or a few minutes of cardio will help. It can increase your heartbeat, increase your blood oxygen level, and put you in an alert state.

# Stay focused

Sometimes, you feel alert in the morning but your mind is wandering so you cannot focus on anything. These tips below bring my mind back, so I hope it works for you.

## 5 min of reading

Tim Ferriss introduced me to this technique. You can read anything that excites you. Just wrap a book or a magazine. This technique is effective because it traps your monkey mind on paper so you can get on with your day. I often look at my daily plan and read it out loud.

## Meditation

By starting a meditation practice and tuning into your breath and body when you first wake up, you become more aware of your thoughtsâ€“and that monkey mind. Some thoughts might make sense while other thoughts seem to come out of nowhere. Especially, when you're wake up after a nightmare.

# Breakfast

Some people avoid sugar and think it makes them fat. That's a myth. A little sugar (below 3 grams) is just fine. If your brain doesn't have enough "sugar", you will start to crave sweet foods. By saying "sugar", I mean you should provide enough energy for your brain in the morning. Energy can come from a lot of sources. I highly recommend people to have *whole foods with high carbs or high proteins or a mix with both of them*.

# Keep your mouth clean

Some people are very busy or lazy so they don't even put a few minutes to clean their mouths. Early meetings make people feel annoyed because of bad breath. Keeping your mouth clean is not only a personal norm but a **SOCIAL** norm.
