## My resolutions for 2022

The coronavirus had changed the world and the way we live. I think 2021 was not a challenging year for me. I found it not too difficult to accomplish my career goals and my physical goals. Instead, working from home is pretty cool. I have more spare time to play with my buddies. 

One article of Fobes wrote that 2022 is going to be Malcolm Gladwellâ€™s Tipping Point Year. This article pointed out 22 predictions of the world in 2022. It provides a lot of retrospective ideas for the new year. I highly recommend you read it.
